# Eng 67 DevOps intro

### What is DevOps
* DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

### Why Devops 
* Traditional software development paradigms focus on security as an additional step: A revision or audit once updates are completed and ready to deploy. This is not inherently bad, but it does create some pitfalls, such as missing important issues that are not readily apparent before launch. DevOps, instead, focuses on security as part of the process due to its shortened development window. Moreover, the small, iterative updates reduce the likelihood that malicious or unsecure code will make it to new versions.

 
 
### Challenges of Devops
* There are multiple challenges of devops but here are are few:
* Switching from Legacy Infrastructure to Microservices: In order to reduce stability issues, organisations now use infrastructure as code along with microservices for quicker development along with sharp innovations. Moreover, organisations need to update their hardware and software systems according to the latest trends on a regular basis, so that new systems can co-exist with the existing systems.
* Test Automation: Test Automation holds equal importance as CI/CD deployments. It has been commonly observed that companies tend to neglect test automation and focus more on CI/CD deployments. For DevOps to be a success, continuous testing acts as a key. 
* Change in Culture: The workplace culture undergoes the major amount of transformation while implementing DevOps. It is also one of the most difficult areas of transformation as it is a long term process which also requires a lot of patience and endurance. To make the process a bit easier, enterprises should try and maintain a positive as well as a transparent atmosphere in the workplace. 

### Benefits of Devops
* Faster deployment: Businesses can deploy new processes, systems and applications much more rapidly using DevOps strategies. This is because DevOps deployment will make your business operations more efficient.
* Improved employee morale: Team morale experiences a boost from implementing DevOps. DevOps benefits business by improving office collaboration and communication. The more employees communicate and work together, the better they work together. This improves employee camaraderie and boosts employee morale, which is why it is one of the most effective team management strategies
*  More time for innovation: After DevOps implementation, your business will streamline processes and improve efficiency. This leaves a lot more time for brainstorming and developing new ideas in the work schedule. The more time your business has to innovate and improve, the more your business will grow and succeed.
